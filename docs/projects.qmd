Things that I learned with this project:

1.  Indentations in code are important!
2.  I've become more confident about where to find and create quarto documents and htmls.
3.  To learn how to be patient with myself and giving myself time to learn something entirely new to me.
4.  In the future I'm planning on:
    a.  Working on adding a better theme that will include more colors
    b.  Editing my pg footer so that it looks nicer
